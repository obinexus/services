# OBINexus BlueShare: Bluetooth Pay-As-You-Go WiFi Service

## Service Overview

**Division**: OBINexus Computing  
**Classification**: Department-level infrastructure service  
**Framework Integration**: Hot-wiring Architecture compatible

Transform individual mobile data plans into shared, cost-efficient group connectivity through Bluetooth mesh networking with real-time microtransaction cost sharing. Enable "decentralized mesh WiFi piggybacking with Venmo-style" payments.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize BlueShare service
./scripts/blueshare_init.sh

# Create a network with star topology
./scripts/create_network.sh --topology=star --duration=3600

# Join existing network
./scripts/join_network.sh --network-id=<network_id>

# Monitor usage and costs
./scripts/monitor_session.sh
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Bluetooth LE Protocol**: Device discovery and mesh coordination
- **Mobile Hotspot Integration**: Internet connectivity sharing across platforms
- **Lightning Network**: Instant microtransaction processing
- **Node-Zero Privacy**: Zero-knowledge usage tracking and payment verification
- **GosiLang Threading**: Thread-safe multi-device communication

### Network Topologies
```
Star Topology:     Single host device shares connection
Bus Topology:      Daisy-chain connectivity with failover
Distributed Mesh:  Multiple hosts with load balancing  
Hybrid Adaptive:   Dynamic switching based on conditions
```

### Cost Calculation
```
Session Cost = (Data Usage MB × Cost per MB) + Session Fee + Quality Bonus
Fair Share = Total Cost ÷ Active Participants
Privacy-Preserved Payment via Lightning Network
```

## OBINexus Computing Integration

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Star Network
```bash
# Host creates network
./blueshare_cli create-network --topology=star --cost-per-mb=100

# Clients join network
./blueshare_cli join-network --network-id=<id> --role=client

# Monitor session
./blueshare_cli monitor --show-costs --show-bandwidth
```
