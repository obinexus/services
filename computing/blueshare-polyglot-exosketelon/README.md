# BlueShare Polyglot Exoskeleton Topology System (BPETS)

**Vision Document — OBINexus Computing**

*Purpose*: define the vision, architecture, and rollout plan for BPETS — a polyglot, non‑monolithic infrastructure that maps human skeletal topology to distributed BlueShare networking topologies and language bindings for exoskeleton systems used in civil‑collapse, rescue, and resilience operations.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

BPETS is a design and runtime framework that treats an exoskeleton as a distributed system: mechanical subsystems map to network topologies and to language/runtime modules. The goal is to deliver a robust, auditable, and constitutional deployment stack that:

* Supports multi‑language adapters (Node, Rust, Python, Go, Lua, C), semverx tagged.
* Preserves behavioural "consciousness" (confidence, cluster, phenomenohog metadata).
* Enables resilient connectivity via BlueShare (Bluetooth pay‑as‑you‑go mesh) as primary local comms and multi‑hop relays as failover.
* Prioritises safety: kinematic invariants, joint protection, inverse‑kinematics + Hamiltonian/Eulerian path optimisations.

This doc is a living product vision, spec, and rollout plan for design teams and integrators.

## 2. Objectives & Success Criteria

### Objectives

* Produce an interoperable polyglot runtime that mirrors the exo skeleton topology.
* Provide deterministic safety controls (joint limits, energy budgets, fail indicators).
* Ensure constitutional compliance (transparency, fairness, privacy).
* Make documentation bilingual / localized (including Igbo glossary for cultural deployment).

### Success Metrics

* Integration readiness across 5 runtimes within 8 weeks.
* CI passing: glue purity + consciousness checks with manifest for every release.
* Safety: joint tension/overstress detection < 10ms from event.
* Resilience: connection failover within 1s and 99% successful microtransaction settlement for paygo sessions.

## 3. Concepts & Mappings

### Biological → Network → Runtime mapping (summary)

* **Skull (ọkpụkpụ isi)** → Control Node / Orchestrator → **Node.js** (CLI & UI)
* **Spine (ọkpụkpụ azụ)** → Bus / Backbone relay → **Rust** (core, threading)
* **Ribcage (ọkpụkpụ obi)** → Protective Mesh → **Go** (monitoring, QoS)
* **Arms/Hands (aka / mkpịsị aka)** → Edge clients & manipulators → **Python / Lua** (AI scripts / embedded)
* **Pelvis (ọkpụkpụ afo)** → Central hub / C core → **C** (real-time kernel)
* **Legs/Feet (ụkwụ / mkpịsị ụkwụ)** → Load relays & mobile endpoints → **Rust/Go + mobile SDKs**

### Safety topologies & motion math

* Use **Hamiltonian cycle** reasoning to model energy transfer and conservation during motion sequences; prioritise paths that maximise dexterity-of‑freedom under constraints.
* Use **Eulerian traversal / edge coverage** for force/trajectory planning when edge continuity matters (load carrying, repeated cycles).
* Inverse kinematics + invariant enforcement for joint safety: every actuator has a guaranteed torque/position envelope; exceedance triggers graded safe shutdown and alerts.

## 4. Phenomenologic Data Model (PDS) — short

Every runtime and deployment must publish a `consciousness_manifest.json` that binds objective data + phenomenohog (subjective/contextual) overlay. This manifest is used by `consciousness-check.py` and CI to assert preservation.

Key fields: `version`, `threshold`, `nodes[]`, `relations[]`, `subjective[]` (person/instance/context entries). Manifests are append-only for subjective entries.

## 5. BlueShare Integration

### Roles

* **Local mesh**: BlueShare runs on wearable hosts to provide low‑latency P2P comms (BLE mesh, BlueShare polyglot protocol).
* **PayGo**: microtransactions use Lightning Network integration for fair cost-sharing of mobile data used as external internet gateway.
* **Failover**: BlueShare bridges to WiFi/cellular via mobile hosts; self‑healing mesh promotes other hosts as gateways.

### Interfaces

* `GET /api/v1/semverx/{slice}` — query semantic tags.
* `POST /api/v1/register-binding` — register language binding.
* `POST /api/v1/sync` — CI-triggered sync for slice.

---

## 6. Safety & Compliance

### Safety systems

* **Joint safety envelope**: per-joint torque/angle limits; on-limit events trigger haptic + visual cues and safe‑mode (partial assist or cutout).
* **Energy budgeting**: mechanical-first design (pulleys, springs) reduces electrical draw; battery + backup pack + solar trickle charge.
* **Redundancy**: dual wireless channels (BlueShare primary + BlueShare secondary / mobile data) and backup power.

### Legal & Governance

* **Zero Trust** for documentation & firmware updates (signed tags).
* **#NoGhosting**: traceable ownership & milestone metadata in manifests.
* **Accessibility / Ethical**: enforced in tests (WCAG + constitutional checks) and queries in CI.

## 7. Localization & Cultural Glossary (Igbo sample)

Include an Igbo glossary file `docs/glossary/igbo_exo_glossary.md` covering skeleton and exo terms. Example entries:

* *Extraordinary* — *pụrụ iche*
* *Exoskeleton* — *ngwá nkwado anụ ahụ* or *akpụkpọ anụ igwe*
* Skull — *Ọkpụkpụ isi*, Spine — *Ọkpụkpụ azụ*, Elbow — *Nkuku aka*, Knee — *Ikpere*

Rendering: objective fields first, phenomenohog annotations collapsible in UI.

## 9. CI/CD & Tests

### Required checks

* `git-subdex validate` (index + checksum + semverx)
* `consciousness-check.py --source . --threshold <t>`
* `glue-check` (anti-pattern lint)
* Functional: joint safety sim, power budget sim, network failover sim

### Playbook (PR gating)

1. Lint + glue-check
2. Build polyglot artifacts
3. Run safety sims (fast deterministic)
4. Publish preview site
5. On tag, publish semverx + register-binding

* **Week 7–8**: mobile SDKs + Lua edge bindings.
* **Week 9–10**: pilot with exo prototype (mechanical minimal) + real‑world tests.
* **Week 11–12**: compliance audits, localization, public documentation release.

## 11. Minimal Commands & Examples

```bash
# validate docs + manifest
npx git-subdex validate
./core/tools/consciousness-check.py --source . --threshold 0.954
make build-all
./scripts/run-safety-sim.sh --profile=joint-envelope
```

---

## 12. Next Immediate Deliverables (for you)

1. Drop a seed `consciousness_manifest.json` into `schemas/` (I can generate a template).
2. I will produce the `docs/glossary/igbo_exo_glossary.md` fully formatted.
3. Create a GH Actions `ci.yml` that enforces glue‑purity and consciousness checks.

*Vision note*: this is deliberately pragmatic — mechanical first, software second; protocol‑first glue; culture-aware localization. If we stick to these constraints the system will avoid the "double‑glue" anti‑pattern and remain auditable, testable, and survivable in the field.
