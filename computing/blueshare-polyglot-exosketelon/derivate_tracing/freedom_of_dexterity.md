Perfect ‚Äî I see what you‚Äôre driving at. You want a **formal mathematical definition** of your ‚Äúfreedom of texture / dexity‚Äù metric, expressed in rigorous terms (Hamiltonian + Eulerian graph theory, with roll/pitch/yaw as basis). Let me set it out clearly.

# üìê Formal Definition: **Freedom of Dexterity (FoD)**

## 1. Configuration Space

Let the **configuration space** of a mechanical or civil skeletal system be:

$$
\mathcal{C} = SO(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3
$$

* $SO(3)$: rotational group (roll, pitch, yaw)
* $\mathbb{R}^3$: translational space (x, y, z)

A **state** is:

$$
q = (x,y,z, \theta_x, \theta_y, \theta_z) \in \mathcal{C}
$$

where:

* $x,y,z \in \mathbb{R}$ (Cartesian or polar displacement)
* $\theta_x, \theta_y, \theta_z \in [-\pi,\pi]$ (Euler angles roll, pitch, yaw)

---

## 2. Graph-Theoretic Representation

We model the skeleton/structure as a **bi-directional Eulerian subgraph**:

$$
G = (V,E)
$$

* **Vertices $V$:** joints/nodes (degrees of freedom, DoF)
* **Edges $E$:** structural links (beams, tendons, exoskeleton struts)

Each edge has a **Hamiltonian weight** $H_e$, derived from energy constraints:

$$
H_e = T_e + V_e
$$

where $T_e$ = kinetic term, $V_e$ = potential term (elasticity, stress).

---

## 3. Freedom of Dexterity (FoD) Metric

We define **FoD** as the **reachable dimensionality of motion** within bounded energy:

$$
FoD(G) = \dim \Big( \bigcup_{v \in V} \mathcal{R}(v) \Big)
$$

where:

* $\mathcal{R}(v) \subset \mathcal{C}$ = reachable configuration set from vertex $v$, constrained by edges and energy balance ($H_e \leq H_{max}$)
* $\dim(\cdot)$ = algebraic dimension of the motion manifold

Thus:

* **FoD = 3** ‚Üí translational-only
* **FoD = 6** ‚Üí full dexterity (x,y,z + roll, pitch, yaw)
* **FoD < 6** ‚Üí constrained by graph symmetry or collapse

---

## 4. Eulerian Subgraph Condition

To ensure **continuity of motion** (no deadlock), the following holds:

$$
\forall v \in V: \deg(v) \equiv 0 \pmod{2}
$$

This guarantees **Eulerian traversal** of the graph (movement cycles without structural dead ends).

---

## 5. Hamiltonian Stability Constraint

We impose:

$$
\mathcal{H}(t) = \sum_{e \in E} H_e(t) \leq H_{crit}
$$

so the skeleton does not collapse due to excessive stress/strain.

---

## 6. Practical Interpretation

* **Civil collapse model:** FoD decreases as joints/edges fail ‚Üí early warning metric.
* **Exoskeleton design:** FoD = 6 is desired for human-like motion.
* **Polyglot protocol analogy:** Graph traversal = information flow, Eulerian/Hamiltonian conditions = coherence preservation.
